                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Founded in 2000, our school has established itself as a respected institution for creative and academic education in Tbilisi. What began as a small initiative led by a group of passionate and dedicated teachers has steadily evolved into a comprehensive educational complex. Over the years, the school has continuously expanded its programs, facilities, and teaching methods to meet the changing needs of modern education, while remaining committed to strong academic values and personal development..</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Mission</h3>
                    <p>Our mission is to educate and inspire students to become confident, responsible, and forward-thinking individuals. We strive to cultivate critical thinking, creativity, and kindness, ensuring that each student is prepared not only for academic success but also for the challenges of the future. We believe education goes beyond memorizing information. It is about understanding the world, developing independent thought, and acquiring the skills necessary for lifelong learning and meaningful participation in society.</p>
